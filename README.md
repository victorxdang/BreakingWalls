# Breaking Walls
 

A casual endless runner game inspired by the likes of Temple Run and Subway Surfer. Unlike the former games, Breaking Walls add an element of color and color-matching to the mix, making the player decide on which color is best suited for the situation.

## Gameplay
---
* Tap on the ball to switch colors.
* Match the color of the ball to the color of the wall to break through it. Otherwise you'll bonk your ball on the wall.
* Color-changing walls!
* The more walls you break, the higher your score!
* Speed of the game increases with the more walls you break.
* Use either the tilt function of the phone or swipe with your fingers to move the ball from side-to-side (no jumping, sorry).
* Relaxing background music to listen to.

* Walls shatter using basic physics.
* All platforms (including walls) seen in the game are pooled, only 5 platforms (plus 3 walls for each platform) are spawn and used througout the entire game to preserve system resources and maintain performance.
* The ball stays in place while the platforms move towards the player.
* The length of the platform and bridges are dynamically adjusted based on the current speed of the game.
